∗ What do you think being a data scientist is about?

Being a data scientist is about solving problems using data rather than using theory and estimations

∗ What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

Similarities:

-   Foundation of math and probability

-   Involved in data analysis and interpretation

Differences:

-   Statisticians focus more on theory and models

-   Data science is more interdisciplinary overlapping with computer science

∗ How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I view myself closer to a data scientist, i enjoy the theory and rigor of statistics but working with real world data to solve problems is far more enjoyable.

```{r}
y <- density(iris$Petal.Width)
```

Determining the class, type and structure of y

```{r}
class(y)
typeof(y)
str(y)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(y)
```
